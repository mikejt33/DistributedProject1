00:13:42Z	SarekOfVulcan	rv - hope you don't actually think sex and surgery are related beyond alphabetically 
00:18:39Z	Chooserr	rvt...I'll list the reasons on the talk if you can wait a few seconds :) 
00:28:28Z	SarekOfVulcan	remove talc ref for invalid comparison between methods of entering abdominal cavity 
00:32:35Z	Chooserr	rvt...I don't really understand where you are coming from. It's used on the lubricant of the condom - when the condom is inside it (the lubricant) can rub off or do what ever it does...use talk pls 
02:13:02Z	Chooserr	There is a difference between N-nitrosamine and normal nitrosamines - Or they wouldn't have seperate names right? :D 
02:18:01Z	SarekOfVulcan	restored nitrosamine link 
03:43:10Z	Ytrewqt		RV! there are holes in that edit summary I could fly a jet through 
03:49:23Z	SarekOfVulcan	rv: replaced red-link with blue-link, and restore the text associated with it. 
03:51:33Z	Ytrewqt		rv, I don't see ANY evidence that the origional charges are false, smark, smark, smark, keep smarking and some day it will come back and bite you in the ass 
03:52:26Z	FCYTravis	rv, perfectly well-sourced rebuttal. 
04:13:48Z	Chooserr	addition with link will find more if anyone protests, but lets discus before reverting 
04:19:33Z	FCYTravis	Seems fair. 
04:21:01Z	FCYTravis	rm "abdominal cavity" stuff - going into the vagina doesn't go into the abdominal cavity. the uterus is not the abdominal cavity. 
04:23:15Z	FCYTravis	woops, MY BAD! :D copyedits 
04:23:56Z	FCYTravis	more copyedits 
04:55:10Z	Chooserr	started condoms & environment section - might be a great addition will look for further information 
05:07:22Z	SarekOfVulcan	cites needed. Bring the section back when you have them. 
05:09:13Z	Chooserr	hold on a sec will get them, google bag it and bin it though.... 
05:10:11Z	Chooserr	/* Condoms & the Environment */ 
05:17:18Z	Chooserr	since this section is about the UK I've decided I will not refrain from using alongst which I feel more comfortable with in this situation 
05:27:53Z	Rose_Garden	Rv. Restore sourced material. 
05:28:46Z	Ytrewqt		rv, I seem to have picked up a wiki stalker, that didn't take long 
05:30:23Z	Rose_Garden	Rv. I'm on vandal patrol. What do you expect? 
05:35:53Z	Chooserr	rvt to my last version before Ytrewqt came - some important information was deleted 
06:59:41Z	Chooserr	/* Prevalence of condoms */ removed section on purchasing condoms for it doesn't belong in this particular section 	
07:45:48Z	Chooserr	please stop vandalising wikipedia 




08:42:42Z	Locke_Cole	/* Proper use */ restoring proper use section 
08:46:10Z	Chooserr	this was already voted on, bring it up on the talk page before making edits like tht 
08:51:07Z	Locke_Cole	rvt 
08:57:40Z	Chooserr	rvt it was agreed on 
10:35:47Z	FCYTravis	/* Condoms & the Environment */ Stupid. You might as well add such a section to [[McDonalds]] or [[Hamburger]] or [[Soda]]. 
10:43:10Z	FCYTravis	/* Environmental impact */ 
16:29:56Z	ip:63.22.0.39	rvt 
16:36:26Z	Locke_Cole	rvt - rewrite was better 
16:46:57Z	ip:63.22.0.39	rvt - censorship 
16:50:51Z	FreplySpang	rv: Agree that FCYTravis' rewrite was better, and no, it's not censorship. Discuss on talk if you disagree. 
16:59:36Z	ip:63.22.0.39	rvt - and since you're using puppets to avoid [[WP:3RR|the 3RR rule]], I'll count this as your 3rd rvt 
17:18:46Z	ip:63.22.0.39	restore {{sprotect}} template 
17:29:11Z	FreplySpang	remove misused sprotect template; revert to FCYTravis' version as discussed on talk 
19:12:37Z	Chooserr	/* Environmental impact */ put my version back - has specific sources - but left the bit about Polyethylene condoms and their landfill mass being negligible because that is important 
20:40:12Z	FCYTravis	rm sensationalism "holy god no condoms are damaging the environment OH NOES!!!!111!!eleven!1!1!" Bin it. 
21:04:54Z	ip:63.22.55.169	rvt to last concensus version, abusive edit summaries won't get you anywhere 
21:11:40Z	FCYTravis	There's hardly a consensus for that version. 
21:18:13Z	ip:63.22.55.169	rv to last (pre-troll)version 
21:25:35Z	La_goutte_de_pluie	rv censorship
